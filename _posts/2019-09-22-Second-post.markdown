Lab 4 was about jekyll styling, and themes that can be implemented. The whole themes in jekyll are new to me. I struggled with copying them in when not using longhual, and I had a slight problem getting images to work, which ended up being a spelling error on my part. I look forward to getting into the database side of websites, seeing how information is stored and SQL, and other frameworks that can be used.
