## Ruby On Rails
Seems like a good option to use, Ruby on Rails seems to set up alot of the framework basics for you. It tries to use more basic English language getting rid of semi colons. Similar to how markdown is.
Seems harder to learn upfront though.

## Django
This would be interesting to use, but the routing system seems a bit confusing on how to use it. Seems easier to use than Rails or ASP.net in the start. It does have some benefits when building the structures out.

## Flask
Compared to Django this routing system seems easier. Also uses python which everyone know already in the class. Seems like would be used for single webpage and not for whole website and database.

## ASP.net
I really liked this framework because it used visual studios that i have previous experience with. Seems very complicated but could be good for large websites with tons of information. It seems easy to launch and use overall.

## Laravel
It uses PHP, and seems very popular overall. The creators have many tutorials and instructions. Looked very hard to set up and run into many issues. I do not have experience with PHP so would need to learn and understand that. This seems to be able to handle alot and be heavyweight framework.
