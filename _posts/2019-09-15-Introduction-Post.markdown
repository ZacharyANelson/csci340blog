Setting up this blog was not too hard, by following the steps.
Both
1. Ruby,
2. jekyll

and markdown are all new to me. The hardest part was installing ruby, the first time the bundle install
didn't work properly. Using the command line is a bit different then used to but not that difficult.
 I am looking foward to making more website and getting into the database side of csci 340.
