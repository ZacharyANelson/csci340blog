In lab 5, I have learned about Data modeling, This started off as making a
Draw.io model of a auction website. I have had to think about what item could go
into each table. Then i needed to think about the relationships between the tables.
Many to one, one-to-one, or any other types of relationships.

Then once I had the Draw.io I made the Vertabelo, which helps you model my tables.
Learned about primary key and foreign keys.
