The skills that are needed to bring a concept to reality with a group are very useful. The first skill needed is to listen to the clients needs and wants. Then come back to them with a timeline that is realistic of what can happen and what may not be possible. The next important skill is to be able to explain the basics of technology to a non-technical person. Creating a website that anyone can use and able to find child care is very important. The next very important skill we learned as team is delegation. Figuring out who does each part, sometimes came to an issue where people may not have communicated very well and both did the same work.

	This leads me to the next point, Communication is key, Making sure we set up our meetings with community partner, then arrived at least 5 minutes early. Making sure to show professionalism and listen to their opinions of our work. When we first met our community partner she admitted to not being very good with computers. We had to figure out how to make sure technically things were explained well, and clearly. We made moqups to give a visual representation of the final website, which she eagerly agreed that it looked good.

	The website we create will hopefully make it easier for parents and teachers to develop new skills and get the resources they need. This will help many lower-income families find child care, and teachers develop skills and new activities to teach the children that come to them. This is one of the first classes and project that I can see will have long term impact on the community. Child Care Aware helps so many children with daycare, but more importantly teaches other skills to help the children even more. This will have greater impact as it spreads out. With the website and being able to see who attends what classes, Child Care Aware can see whats most important so that they can teach it more and have greater impact on society.

	The skills I learned and developed more are crucial for my own future also. Working with a team was a wonderful experience, especially on a project that will help the children of the community.
